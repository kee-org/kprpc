Javascript implementation of a KeePassRPC server

See an example use in (Kee Vault)[https://github.com/kee-org/keevault]

May require a few tweaks to integrate with projects other than Kee Vault but it shouldn't be too hard and pull requests are welcome. Just open an issue on GitHub to discuss any rough edges around the API.
